# Larastack Frontend 🚀

This is the frontend part of the Larastack project, a fullstack starter template that combines the power of Laravel for the backend and Next.js for the frontend. This project is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and includes various tools and components to streamline the development process.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Next.js**: A powerful React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.
- **Panda CSS**: A styling engine used for writing CSS-in-JS, providing flexibility and ease of use in styling components.

## Features ✨

- **GraphQL Integration**: Easily create and manage GraphQL endpoints.
- **OAuth Login**: Simplified user authentication.
- **Custom Components**: A set of custom components to ease development when building new features.

## Getting Started 🏁

First, run the development server:

```bash
